In order to do that your child has to learn English letters and combine them into words, which represent the names of the captured animals. \r\n\r\nIt’s not a big secret that many kids can face difficulties learning to read in English, because English letters in real words have different pronunciation rules in comparison with their sounds in the English alphabet. \r\n\r\n“Learn to Read & Save the Animals” educational game offers efficient Phonics techniques in order to learn how to read in English. During the process of playing the educational game the children will hear the sound of each English letter in exactly the same way as it’s pronounced in the shown word. \r\n\r\nIt allows your child to understand the rules of English word reading on the subconscious level.

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKG8T","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Train Sim","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13594.9007199266527422.9f3c3877-0d7e-40c7-96b2-afc95b191205.8911a979-5765-49d6-b7da-27436e6a9ab2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33861.9007199266527422.ae9b2abd-544b-4228-ad6e-72711a3d2008.a15a4d2a-6bc9-489a-9259-d8a095f5175b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38080.9007199266527422.2cc1e537-2efe-46c8-bf9b-d2c4c3fdaefe.19f24592-4328-41a8-a77f-548c14b74440","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["41529AdamBerent.KidsTrains_49mtw88kkrk9j"],"ContentIds":["4da149cc-6bd7-4596-1e5f-70ee5375c4ae"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Kids Trains allows you to control a train as it goes around a track.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCL6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pet Run","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20283.9007199266251673.c061039e-b28f-492f-8e76-56cf844afe1a.f6c970b7-201d-4767-9b9e-65f909bcb48f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50848.9007199266251673.ca085d88-c16d-4031-9c8e-403ad24d13e4.5ea9c076-3fbd-41d5-96e3-40f6177b3e38","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40736.9007199266251673.b9a18931-fde2-4cc5-8670-46c822fa47cb.2dad419a-d8d9-43e9-be0d-37b3032fdca2","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27795.9007199266251673.42b72496-2c9e-4179-bf1a-d7bd3fb98485.30b29f01-8566-4349-83e7-c865fa621170","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50857.9007199266251673.74922225-dee6-40b0-8c8f-609db5983a30.dfe402c4-c7e2-4a85-95ef-4f03f6b17549","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35029.9007199266251673.ebcc6ea0-c852-4c28-8d26-adf18e8c1e34.2c6ea22e-cbac-4a4a-80f4-43f9db3ecaab","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35604.9007199266251673.b25f8247-b101-4409-a318-580633593353.18cd31d0-780c-4a87-8ea4-0a7886c2e545","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2724ZoltnGubics.PetRun_d5xggy273m32g"],"ContentIds":["253ed302-2eca-da6e-930d-0f09454943df","be222710-4e43-2c16-cafd-cd7ffde55811","b06c08e8-eb43-affc-04ba-7e03ff7febb0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pet Run is a fast-paced endless runner with intuitive controls and randomized gameplay.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MXKDQKFJGBJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tower Builder -

Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi, but simpler. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.\r\n\r\nHow to play Ludo Table :\r\nEach player gets to choose tokens of one of the four colors (green, yellow, red or blue). These tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. The player who gets all four tokens to the finish line first is the winner.\r\nHowever, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided dice, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a number six on the dice. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo Table is board game played between friends, family & kids.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N7766T3ZX43","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Worms Slither Online","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29040.14070136018195828.74c34200-3806-40e8-9b1a-3f787f1380d2.10e8c362-2912-46da-9009-7c6d4eec8343","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61633.14070136018195828.74c34200-3806-40e8-9b1a-3f787f1380d2.6fd14dfe-2b41-4adb-92f4-520c1df5c958","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29040.14070136018195828.74c34200-3806-40e8-9b1a-3f787f1380d2.10e8c362-2912-46da-9009-7c6d4eec8343","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["15099SimKidsAdventureGame.WormsSlitherOnline_zsk4ancj3a1sw"],"ContentIds":["7a4c8e7a-2ec5-e339-9d27-4801a7ba0dad","0d79a746-e9a9-44f1-57d9-f0f3864f1bc3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy slithering!

for your Windows.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a puzzle game Retris (inspired by classic retro Tetris blocks) started on non-graphic displays. The new versions of the game are much brighter and diverse. Retris is one of the best in our opinion, although one can find dozens of Bricks, Blocks, Pentomino and 1010!-like games in the Internet. But it is still essentially the same game that was originally Quadris (classic puzzle Tetris).\r\n\r\nYou can choose number of figures – 9 as in the classical version; 11 – a mix of three and four bricks; Pentax, 17 – all the figures. You can moderate type of figure movement (fluent/intermittent), initial speed, figure colors (as in Tetcolor). At the same time there are no frills, and classic Tetris and Tetcolor lovers might grow fond of it.\r\n\r\nRetris has two color modes: in the first one all pieces of a certain type consist of blocks of the same color. The bottom part that is not burned is composed of disparate units if mixed colors - the remnants of the thrown shapes.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is when a falling figure is composed of red blocks, and the bottom blocks (made of the fallen ones)  are blue.\r\n\r\nRetris provides an opportunity to show a transparent grid that divides a figure into blocks.\r\n\r\nThe game can show a “phantom” – an identical “twin” of a falling figure to help you see where it is better to place it.\r\n\r\nOne can choose a mode of control type in Quadris: if you prefer to play holding your smartphone or tablet with two hands, you can select a mode in which the control buttons are situated to the left and to the right from the game field.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option \"play with one hand\" in Quadris, the control buttons are placed to the right from the playing field on your smartphone or tablet screen.\r\n\r\nYou can compete with other players as in many other puzzle games. It is possible to play anonymously or to register and get your unique nickname. After that your results get into the global chart.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the auto-save function if your game is interrupted by a call or any other program switch on the smartphone!\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n- Create horizontal lines using the falling blocks;\r\n- When you make a line of blocks, it is cleared from the screen;\r\n- The game is over when the blocks pile up and reach the top of the screen;\r\n- You get more points for completing multiple lines at once.\r\n\r\nYou can play the new version of Quadris either online and offline. The game may be of interest both to adult fans of the classic Tetris game and to attract the younger generation, it is as easy to use as educational online games.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of classic puzzle games – Tetris and other related puzzle games like Quadris, Pentax, etc. – has been repeatedly studied by scientists. If one believes their opinion, downloading a free puzzle game (like Quadris or Tetris), you get both a free shrink and a free nutritionist – it is believed that classic puzzle and logic games may relieve stress, may help to ease one’s condition after psychological problems and may reduce the risk of overeating by switching attention to the game. As opposed to the \"shooters\", Quadris and other classic puzzles can calm, giving a feeling that you put your life in order and under control along with the blocks on the playing field.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and join the wonderful company of smart puzzle-crackers!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NR1Q","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Babie Rock Star","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37495.13510798887469111.f452b374-a73d-48c6-9fee-5421d41654c5.57efeb3c-81af-4a37-9748-ae7a06159247","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65052.13510798887469111.9b18dc2b-0bfa-4d4c-a3ff-0e3bc58d0a90.0e1b8267-aa73-44a8-bf50-bf4f5886f124","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7219.13510798887469111.f22a9c9a-9eb4-4c75-8c43-b0e741f2fb66.c818df15-9328-41b4-be72-d0b316a0c800","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12925.13510798887469111.d1b2b3c6-53cf-4b47-9667-6e09bf1e1851.1ff76273-e8af-40df-a552-206329057cf7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["29654uslight.BabieRockStar_j11n5d0xh9kme"],"ContentIds":["a79b43f3-e1f4-2578-810a-9e568236fd74","2db910cc-f16d-ca71-86ff-10a8ba76c6ba","13040e31-5b89-fa02-8726-a39d257de651"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Babie is trying to get a band together.

The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game.

Each player, in turn, clockwise, must follow suit if able; if unable to follow suit, the player may play any card. A trick containing a spade is won by the highest spade played; if no spade is played, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG0ZH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Brightstone Mysteries: Paranormal Hotel HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11171.9007199266305986.8f7195c0-094d-4d40-9a57-01ac714c1ad3.63fbe675-ef5c-45f5-b1f3-bac92ecfbf3a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034797","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2367.9007199266305986.0a450b6c-e1dc-4e16-9ee1-2834cc4ff3eb.e94d4c0a-ac55-4ed7-bd92-c03a4935ba06","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034797","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.BrightstoneMysteriesParanormalHotel_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["55d71e93-7a7d-0808-0236-9124824c3bdb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Unravel the secrets of the Templars and an ancient Egyptian cult in this thrilling adventure!\r\nNew York City Detective Bridget “Biggi” Brightstone has come to France to crack the case of a missing necklace in a haunted castle-turned-hotel.

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDK4KM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"MineSweeper (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5306.9007199266520798.aa665d60-ac13-4776-aeea-4e5a712805f1.7938e915-f290-4999-a352-83ccad202ec3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266520798.a8271344-a175-4f03-8fc0-f4975c4d1c86.3ae80966-3934-48da-9718-6f7a58340e69","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["50834ZAppsStudio.MineSweeperFree_fr8j70y4p4pst"],"ContentIds":["3ed47e06-197d-bd64-bb65-07d9aa44a61d","37af19aa-79db-a4b4-8996-0f9169231a98","1d6251cf-030f-7ceb-89ab-8d975d91b721"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"MineSweeper is classic windows game.\r\n\r\nMinesweeper is a logic game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM822","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Puzzle Craft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7411.9007199266447233.48518232-d1f0-4089-9d76-ec855f66bc21.9f05e1eb-142f-47fa-82a4-03e7cb24a5f0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2681.9007199266447233.cc07b5e6-8c81-42c2-b209-8a1d69d558b8.fe949171-9e5f-416c-98b3-9499fd4eeca3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["0BCF39DC.PuzzleCraft_7r58kgx22y7jj"],"ContentIds":["3c3cc9e7-37b5-92d3-bc07-47c0c5bf5016"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Some villagers have started a new settlement and they've put you in charge.
