Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are.

Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds.

Not a lot, just a little bit, every day, hidden away in a vent. This was no easy feat in a totalitarian world where everything and every person was accounted for every minute of the day. A genius scientist, Number 221 was under orders to mass produce chemical missiles and viruses that would be strategically spread to deal with population control. He was under contract. Under orders. Under control. Number 221 was planning mutiny. But how do you destroy monsters without becoming one of them? There was no guarantee he'd survive. The medicine dissolved easily in the coffee, leaving no trace of evidence behind. He poured a cup for himself, and his guard. He sipped the poison, the antidote tucked safely in his lab coat. His guard did not have the same benefit. As his insides began to write in result, he waited for evidence the poison too was effecting his companion. As the man fell to the ground, Number 221 flipped the lid of the vial and tossed back the contents. The guard was a fool to trust a scientist, especially one willing to drink his own poison to ensure his success. Number 221 stepped over the body, drew a vial of the odious man's blood to pass security, and slipped from the lab he knew all too well. He wasn't anywhere close to being free. The safe house was a far way off and they would notice his absence soon. They would not risk losing him. He was too valuable. To survive, he was going to need to be careful. He was going to need to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n★☆★☆Battle for Supremacy ★☆★☆\r\nAre you skilled enough, fast enough, powerful enough, and capable enough to eliminate all targets and complete the map in a designated time?

Enemies are everywhere and you must defeat every last one in order to claim the title as ultimate victor. \r\n\r\n??Time is running out...??\r\n\r\nI am a prisoner on a planet in a galaxy devoid of human life. I know little about my origins, only that the planet had seen a total annihilation of human life centuries ago at the hands of the robots who dominated it and I was the last human on earth. I exist in a cell so tiny that I cannot lay flat, but rather have to sleep in the fetal position. My cell is always cold and drips waste from the city above. I have seen light very few times in my existence, but when I have, I was chained in manacles and paraded about the city to the delight of the robots and their fat, alien comrades. I harbored no hope of leaving this place. That was, until six months ago when I heard it whispered between wardens that a planet was discovered where humans not only exist, they thrive. The word war was being bandied about, but I cared naught of their tactics, for the first bloom of hope had sprung to life in my chest. For the first time since I was a wee boy and my spunk was beaten mercilessly from me, I was determined to be more than a prisoner. Despite the size of my cage, I refused to let my surroundings hinder my plans of escape. I worked out tirelessly, working my weary bones until I could start to feel the strength building in my body. I would escape, but to fully succeed and reunite with those of my own ilk, I would need to confront these foes and escape this hell hole altogether. This is my tale, the story of how I escaped this planet and vanquished my enemies.\r\n\r\n??Ready your weapons...??\r\n\r\nThis mission features a great variety of enemies, but when you start the game, you will be unarmed. In order to do battle, you must locate and equip a weapon. A selection of melee and firearm weapons exist across the maps. Your entity map will be a valuable asset as it allows you an aerial view of oncoming enemies so you can be prepared to strike. Collect health and ammo perks while you can, for these pickups will decrease as the levels progress making your mission all the more challenging. Let your surroundings aid your quest. Exploding barrels can be found and utilized to strategically take down enemies. Enjoy non-stop FPS action with endless battles and treacherous terrain. \r\n\r\nHow to play: Use the simple touch screen control pad to easily move, fight, select weapons and more. Kill enemies, utilize exploding barrels. Keep an eye out for hidden perks and weapons. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-Addictive and mesmerizing maps\r\n-Efficient weapon controls and movement\r\n-Fight your way against dozens of foes\r\n-Think strategically\r\n-Interactive surroundings\r\n-Heated gun battles and ruthless snipers\r\n-Pixel style defense game\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NTVMH50MXCQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Plants vs Monster Zombies","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53205.14411205708949055.f5fc4d71-5a2d-4670-9f99-9535f4679f5c.07f197b8-b504-48fd-abb7-09d9a3f336a2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44166.14411205708949055.8d5f36d6-633b-4c76-8f99-4f71c88522a2.4b6d1442-7754-4e86-8527-fa535c777352","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53205.14411205708949055.f5fc4d71-5a2d-4670-9f99-9535f4679f5c.07f197b8-b504-48fd-abb7-09d9a3f336a2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["59192DragonPokeGames.PlantsvsMonsterZombies_dqa1dx3zdn60e"],"ContentIds":["25f8754a-38b3-3a5a-ff2d-c690a92b731f","549894ab-4943-5446-a3eb-1dc1f85d3c47"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you like Plants vs. Zombies FREE?

Download today and experience for yourself one of the best first person shooter games available on the market! \r\n\r\n\r\n✲✲✲GAME STORY✲✲✲\r\nWe are an advanced civilization. One that has survived, and even thrived from the apocalypse. We are a world with many technical and otherworldly advances that boast the ability to open portals to other dimensions. This was done in order to study the effects of different consequences and alternate reality. It seemed to be safe enough, with all the safety precautions that were taken, but then the unthinkable happened. \r\n\r\nAfter the sustainment system failed during a massive power outage, the safety shield that kept the portal from being accessed by either side was lowered, and the vacuum ripped several agents from their stations, trapping them in these alternate dimensions...\r\n\r\nAs one of these agents sucked inside the portal, you are now trapped in a dimension where the world is drastically different, and all because of a choice made by a handful of men several millennia ago. This world is a treacherous place filled with dangers at every turn. You must remain alive in this bleak world until help can reach you... IF help can reach you.\r\n\r\n✲✲✲GAME PLAY✲✲✲\r\nThe game comes fully loaded with amazing features! Our new game interface is extremely user friendly, and boasts easy to play touch screen controls that allow you to effortlessly run, jump, sprint, reload, aim, shoot and more! \r\n\r\nThe new menu screen includes map style level select and settings screen. Gain game insight in between maps during loading with tip screens, and begin each game with mission style instructions! Before you begin your first level, you can watch a short video ad in order to earn a power up. You may opt not to watch, but you'll lose out on the advantage. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the game begins, a timer will begin to count down. If you are able to beat the level quickly enough, you will earn a permanent weapon, which can be used in all other levels! If you do not beat the clock, you can still advance through the game, just without the permanent weapon. \r\n\r\nFight stronger, more intelligent enemies, who make this game an intense battle of wit, stealth and skill! Enjoy hand-to-hand combat and precision aiming to take down enemies. Collect your blocky weapons and get ready to aim and shoot!!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-User friendly interface with touch pad controls\r\n-Timers\r\n-Power-ups\r\n-Ammo and weapon collection\r\n-Jump, aim and run\r\n-Mini-map to spot your dangerous foes\r\n-Mission orders\r\n-Hand-to-hand combat","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P16WN1386D8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Car Wash Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2865.14516916750449343.32f16875-063c-40cf-a74d-b9b18dcaba21.e66cfab7-af9f-431e-b7c6-4881770e2355","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58213.14516916750449343.32f16875-063c-40cf-a74d-b9b18dcaba21.c87d1c26-f98f-46ba-9bfd-7621ff02874a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["5625MobileGamesStudio.CarWashGame_4va3atqj0fc0m"],"ContentIds":["504b9f9f-a901-2dfa-e985-f6ac25da0aeb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Car Wash Salon Game is finally open for business - hang on to your seats because we're starting an amazing car wash adventure!

You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again.

Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\r\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\r\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\r\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\r\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third party advertisements that may redirect you to a third party site.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\r\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\r\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5WKLW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pop Stars#","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28922.13510798886376948.dbef68cf-c158-48bb-bfc2-c924e17877d3.16909b57-624a-48b1-a89a-5339e9993590","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["45773TouchGamesStudio.PopStars_wxwgnc9s6s58p"],"ContentIds":["9fe1c631-2554-f702-4c63-a51bb0e0163c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Windows version of pop star game.\r\n\r\nHow To Play:\r\n- Tap two or more blocks of the same color.\r\n- The more blocks you pop, the more score you will get.\r\n- Try to clear all block","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6HJXB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Masha and Bear Alphabet","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29355.13510798886731261.94f02641-bd3f-414d-93fc-a1d0556021be.bd735d3e-7b57-4d06-b95f-40e670058861","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55947.13510798886731261.957921a1-cabd-43f0-9851-0e0216008c08.bb17ce2e-16e7-4af1-83a9-239391e5f51f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38636.13510798886731261.806600e4-87a3-416f-9a43-9ee01bfdb09d.d0879572-dfa9-4b5b-b1e4-52fee144798a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["NEXTSYS.MashaandBearAlphabet_7nf5xgv9mg7fa"],"ContentIds":["5b806d69-c1d5-6702-849b-cfe030e15b9a","786a6761-0f12-7071-dc3c-7bc9cd62df4b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\r\nMasha is a very nice girl, very curious who loves coloring their days of merriment.

Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game. Strike fast and kill enemies in this combat challenge. Collect ammo, HP and speed pickups as you advance. These pickups will decrease though, while the number of enemies increases significantly.
